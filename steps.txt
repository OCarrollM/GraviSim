1: Basic window and rendering loop

use pygame
make static star
click to place planets

2: gravity calculations

f = (g * m1 * m2) / r^2
f = grav force
g = grav constant
m1, m2 = mass
r = distance

create object class to store above (data class?)
calc grav force
update velocities using euler integration

3: interactivity 

user to throw planets or something

click to place planet
click and drag to set a velocity (slingshot)?

4: realism 

planets move realisticly based on size and grav

update pos each frame based on velocity
constant grav force
